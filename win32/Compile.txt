TODO: update this document (here's a start: open gens.sln in Visual Studio 2005 and choose Build Solution. If it complains about ddraw.h missing you'll need to install a DirectX SDK first.)



You need Visual C++ 6.0 with the DirectX 7.0 Runtime library and NASM installed
in the root directory of the drive where you've checked out Gens (\nasm) to
compile Gens project (NASM in included in the sources package, you just need
to move it in the root directory).

Gens uses the Starcream 680x0 library emulation for the genesis and Sega CD
68000 CPU emulation, the core has been customised and optimised for Gens.

Gens project is structured as follow :

- Gens directory contains all gens sources except the CPU cores.
- Main68k directory contains the sources for the main 68000 (genesis 68000).
- Sub68k directory contains the sources for the sub 68000 (Sega CD 68000).
- z80 directory contains the sources for the Z80 cpu (genesis).

I used 2 68000 cores for speed reasons :
- No context swap required.
- Each core is optimised for its function.

Here's the step to follow to compile succefully the win32 vesion of Gens :

- Be sure to have VC (Visual C++) 6.0 with the DirectX 7.0 Runtime library installed.
- Open the Main68k project (DSW file) with VC, build star.exe then close the project.
- Open the Sub68k project with VC, build star.exe then close the project.
- Exec the comp_m68k.bat file.
- Exec the comp_s68k.bat file.
- Open the Gens project with VC and build gens.exe, that's all :)

Gens.exe file is normally build in the gens\release directory.
To uses netplay features, Gens requires kailleraclient.dll, the file should be in
the same directory as gens.exe
